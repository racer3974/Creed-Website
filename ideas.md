  **Design Movement**: **Swiss Style (International Typographic Style) / Neo-Grotesque**
  
  **Core Principles**:
  1.  **Objective Clarity**: Content is presented with mathematical precision, prioritizing readability and structure above all.
  2.  **Asymmetric Balance**: Layouts rely on tension and negative space rather than centered symmetry to create dynamic energy.
  3.  **Grid-Based Rigor**: A strict, visible or invisible modular grid governs every element's placement.
  4.  **Monochromatic Purity**: A strict black and white palette, using shades of gray only for functional hierarchy, no accent colors.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  "Absolute Contrast." Black represents authority and solidity; White represents clarity and openness. The absence of color forces the user to focus entirely on the message and the form. It conveys a no-nonsense, high-performance business attitude.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  **The Modular Offset**. Instead of a single column, the site uses a multi-column grid where text and images often overlap or sit in unexpected (but aligned) positions. Headlines might run vertically or be significantly larger than usual to act as graphic elements.

  **Signature Elements**:
  1.  **Oversized Typography**: Headlines that span the full width or break the grid, acting as the primary visual texture.
  2.  **Thick Rule Lines**: Heavy black (or white in dark mode) horizontal and vertical lines separating sections, emphasizing the grid.
  3.  **High-Contrast Photography**: Images are strictly black and white with high contrast, no mid-tones, giving a "photocopy" or "noir" aesthetic.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  "Snap and Precision." Hover effects are instant and sharp (e.g., inverting colors of a button immediately without fade). Scrolling feels structured, perhaps snapping to sections.

  **Animation**:
  **Kinetic Typography**. Text slides in from behind masks or reveals itself with sharp easing. No soft fades; everything moves with purpose and mechanical precision.

  **Typography System**:
  *   **Primary (Headlines)**: **Helvetica Now Display** or **Inter Tight** (Bold/Black). Tight tracking, massive scale.
  *   **Secondary (Body)**: **Roboto Mono** or **JetBrains Mono**. A monospaced font for data and small details to add a technical, "ad-tech" feel.

  **Design Movement**: **Luxury Minimalist / High-End Editorial**
  
  **Core Principles**:
  1.  **Sophisticated Breath**: Massive amounts of whitespace (or "blackspace") to frame content like art in a gallery.
  2.  **Serif Elegance**: Using a sharp, high-contrast serif font to evoke tradition, trust, and premium service.
  3.  **Fluid Continuity**: Sections flow into each other seamlessly, creating a narrative journey rather than a checklist of information.
  4.  **Subtle Depth**: Using very soft, almost imperceptible shadows or blurs to lift elements off the page, adding a tactile quality.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  "Velvet Noir." Not just #000000 and #FFFFFF, but rich, deep charcoals and soft off-whites (e.g., alabaster). This reduces eye strain and feels more expensive and organic than pure digital black/white.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  **The Editorial Spread**. Layouts mimic high-end fashion magazines. Images are often centered with wide margins, or placed off-center with caption-like text. Text columns are narrow for optimal readability.

  **Signature Elements**:
  1.  **Fine Lines**: Extremely thin (1px) borders and dividers that feel delicate and precise.
  2.  **Parallax Imagery**: Background images move slower than the foreground, creating a sense of depth and immersion.
  3.  **Italicized Accents**: Key words or phrases in headlines are italicized (serif) to add emphasis and a human touch.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  "Graceful Delay." Hovers have a slow, smooth transition (ease-out). Elements float slightly when interacted with.

  **Animation**:
  **Ethereal Fade**. Elements drift upwards and fade in slowly as the user scrolls. Images might have a slow zoom-in effect (Ken Burns) to feel alive.

  **Typography System**:
  *   **Primary (Headlines)**: **Playfair Display** or **Cinzel**. High-contrast serif for a timeless, classy look.
  *   **Secondary (Body)**: **Lato** or **Montserrat** (Light). Clean geometric sans-serif to balance the ornate headlines.

  **Design Movement**: **Brutalist / Digital Noir**
  
  **Core Principles**:
  1.  **Raw Authenticity**: Exposing the structure of the web. Unapologetic, bold, and slightly anti-design.
  2.  **Digital Native**: Embracing screen aesthetics—glitches, terminal cursors, and raw code elements.
  3.  **Information Density**: Presenting data (metrics, ad performance) as a key visual element.
  4.  **Stark Contrast**: Pure black and pure white, with occasional "terminal green" or "error red" only for tiny status indicators (optional, mostly monochrome).

  **Color Philosophy**:
  "The Terminal." A deep, void-like black background is the default. White is used sparingly for text, creating a glowing effect. It feels like looking into the engine of the advertising machine.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  **The Dashboard**. The layout feels like a HUD (Heads-Up Display). Borders are visible, creating distinct zones for navigation, content, and status. It feels like a tool, not just a brochure.

  **Signature Elements**:
  1.  **Marquees**: Scrolling text banners (tickers) showing services or keywords continuously.
  2.  **Monospaced Everything**: Or at least monospaced headers to emphasize the "technical" aspect of ad setup.
  3.  **Visible Grids/Crosshairs**: Small "+" marks at intersections of the grid to show precision.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  "Tactile Feedback." Buttons depress visually. Hover states might invert the entire block (black text on white box).

  **Animation**:
  **Glitch and Typewriter**. Text types itself out. Images might flash or distort slightly on hover before stabilizing.

  **Typography System**:
  *   **Primary (Headlines)**: **Space Grotesk** or **Syne**. Quirky, digital-first sans-serifs.
  *   **Secondary (Body)**: **Space Mono** or **Fira Code**. Strictly monospaced to reinforce the engineering/setup aspect of the service.
